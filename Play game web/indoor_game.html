              Chess is a strategic indoor board game played between two players.

              It is one of the oldest and most popular games in the world.

              The game is played on a square board divided into 64 squares (8 rows and 8 columns).

              Each player has 16 pieces — one side white and the other black.

              The pieces include one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.

              The main goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king.

              “Checkmate” means the king is under attack and has no safe move left.

              Chess requires deep thinking, planning, and concentration.

              Each piece moves in a specific way — for example, knights move in an L-shape and bishops move diagonally.

              The game begins with the player who has white pieces making the first move.

              Chess is governed internationally by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE).

              It can be played both on a physical board and online using computers or mobile apps.

              Famous chess players include Viswanathan Anand, Magnus Carlsen, Garry Kasparov, and Bobby Fischer.

              Chess tournaments are held all over the world, including the World Chess Championship.

              Playing chess helps improve memory, patience, and decision-making skills.

              It is also a great mental exercise that develops problem-solving ability.

              Chess can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

              The game can last from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the level of play.

              Many schools include chess as an educational activity to develop logical thinking in students.

              Chess is often called the “game of kings” because of its history, intelligence, and elegance.

              A card game is a popular indoor game played with a deck of playing cards.

              It can be played by two or more players.

              Card games are played for fun, skill, or sometimes competition.

              A standard deck has 52 cards divided into four suits — hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.

              Each suit has 13 cards — numbers from 2 to 10, plus Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.

              There are many types of card games such as Rummy, Poker, Bridge, Solitaire, and Uno.

              Some card games are based on luck, while others require strategy and planning.

              Players take turns drawing, discarding, or arranging cards according to the rules.

              Rummy and Teen Patti are very popular in India.

              Uno is a colorful and fun card game loved by children and families.

              Card games can be played indoors at home, in clubs, or online.

              They help improve memory, concentration, and decision-making skills.

              In old times, people used cards for entertainment and social gatherings.

              Card games can be both competitive and relaxing.

              Many people play card games during festivals, family get-togethers, or parties.

              Some card games involve bets or scoring systems to decide the winner.

              Playing cards are usually made of paper or plastic-coated material.

              Card games teach patience, strategy, and observation.

              They are suitable for all age groups, from kids to adults.

              Card games are a classic indoor pastime that brings people together for fun and bonding.

              Badminton is a very popular indoor sport played all over the world.

              It is played between two players (singles) or four players (doubles).

              The game is played on a rectangular court divided by a net in the middle.

              A match is usually played as the best of three games, each up to 21 points.

              Players score points when their opponent fails to return the shuttlecock within bounds.

              Badminton requires speed, stamina, accuracy, and quick reflexes.

              It was first played in India and was known as “Poona” before spreading to England.

              Table Tennis, also called Ping Pong, is a popular indoor sport.

              It is played between two players (singles) or four players (doubles).

              The game is played on a rectangular table divided by a net in the middle.

              Players use small paddles/rackets to hit a lightweight ball back and forth.

              The main aim is to score points by making the ball land on the opponent’s side without being returned.

              Table tennis matches are usually played in best of five or seven games, each up to 11 points.

              A player scores a point when the opponent fails to hit the ball back correctly.

              The game requires quick reflexes, concentration, and hand-eye coordination.

              It was invented in England in the late 19th century as a parlor game.

              Table tennis is governed internationally by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).

              It became an Olympic sport in 1988 at the Seoul Olympics.

              The main shots include forehand, backhand, smash, and serve.

              Famous players include Ma Long, Fan Zhendong, Ding Ning, and Sharath Kamal.

              The ball is usually made of celluloid or plastic and weighs about 2.7 grams.

              The paddle is often covered with rubber to allow spin and control.

              Table tennis can be played indoors to avoid wind or external disturbances.

              It helps improve reflexes, agility, and mental alertness.

              The game is enjoyed by children, adults, and professional players worldwide.

              Many schools and clubs organize table tennis tournaments to encourage participation.

              Table tennis is a fun, fast, and healthy sport that promotes skill, focus, and teamwork.
